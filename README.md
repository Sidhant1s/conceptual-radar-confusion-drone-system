## 🛰️ Overview

This repository presents a **conceptual design** for an electronic warfare drone system that:

- Emits multi-frequency signals from various surfaces.
- Mimics missile and aircraft radar signatures to overload and confuse enemy radar systems.
- Triangulates radar source and missile firing location using frequency-based detection.
- Operates autonomously with satellite or AWACS coordination.

## 📌 Features

- Multi-surface frequency emitters  
- Radar location triangulation  
- Real-time frequency variation via AI  
- Swarm-capable deployment  
- Pre-emptive radar blinding
